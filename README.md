Coding task
·         We want you to create a single view Android application
·         Input would be a search term for places used for performing or producing music
·         Output would be places as pins on a map

Requirements
·         Must be written in Java and/or Kotlin
·         Use MusicBrainz API https://wiki.musicbrainz.org/Development.
·         Places returned per request should be limited, but all places must be displayed on map. For example there 100 places for search term, but limit is 20, so you need 5 request to get all the places
·         Make this limit easy to tune in code
·         Displayed places should be open from 1990
·         Every pin has a lifespan, meaning after it expires, pin should be removed from the map. Lifespan calculation: open_year - 1990 = lifespan_in_seconds. Example: 2017 - 1990 = 27s

Karma for:
·         Clean code and best OOP practices
·         Kotlin specific features
·         Test-covered code
